      Choosing where to live is an important decision, and although there is some information about the wood frame houses on Wesleyan's website, there isn't a streamlined way for students to hear from their peers about the pros and cons of living in different Wesleyan houses. That's why we created WesShacks, a platform for users to browse, rate, review, and ask and answer questions about wood frame houses at Wesleyan University.

    <h1 style = "text-align: center;">Maps Feature</h1>
    <p>We plan to implement a maps feature, where each house has a corresponding iframe that shows its location on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a>.</p>
    <p>Here's a sneak peak at the feature:</p>
    <div id="map-container">
      <!-- Show placeholder initially -->
      <div id="map-placeholder">
        <button onclick="loadMap()">Load Google Maps</button>
      </div>
      <!-- Hidden iframe that loads after consent -->
      <iframe 
        id="map-frame" 
        style="display: none"
        src= "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2985.814128323286!2d-72.66026122388756!3d41.55162157127949!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x89e64a63e6bc7f93%3A0xeef5c4082aa86488!2s49%20Brainerd%20Ave%2C%20Middletown%2C%20CT%2006457!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1739839395132!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="600" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">
