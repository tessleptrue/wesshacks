# wesshacks
COMP333 Wesleyan housing forum

A website created by Olivia Bordon, Ford McDill, Chase Yahn-Krafft, and Tess Lepeska-True

The code provided in this repo is the front-end code for WesShacks, a website where people can rate their woodframe houses on campus and evaluate others as well. The code is relatively straightforward; we have 4 html files and 1 css file, all of which make up the framework of our site. The code can be run locally in a browser, but also can be acccessed at https://tessleptrue.github.io/wesshacks/index.html.

Our website has four main parts so far: our landing page, which discusses our mission and gives a background to the site, our explore page, where people can search for houses matching certain criteria, our about us page, and our review submission page, where people can submit a review of a house. AN IMPORTANT NOTE is that this project is only the front-end of WesShacks. In the explore and review pages, the forms do not actually get submitted. We will be adding that in a future release.

As for team breakdown, we all contributed equally to this project.
